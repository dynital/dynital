Hello World! I'm @dynital.
I'm currently a student at ITS Academy, specializing in Cloud.
My main interests are learning to code, playing games and one day to make one of my own.
The programming languages that I'm learning are C++, C#, Python and, on a less serious note (meaning by my self), a little bit of HTML, JavaScript and Java.
Thank you for the attention!
